    <p> ​The COVID-19 situation in Switzerland is already normalizing and we expect further easing steps to follow. Therefore, we plan to hold DevOpsDays Zurich 2021 as an in-person event. However, we will work out a detailed COVID-19 concept for the event which will be updated constantly, to make the situation on site as safe as possible for everyone. The detailed COVID-19 concept will be communicated at a later point in time. </p>
