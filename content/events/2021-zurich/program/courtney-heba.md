### Workshop

Last year we implemented first Mob Programming pilot at Delta’s Dojo, a technique used to write software code utilizing 4-5 team members instead of a single programmer which reduces costs by 9% per deployment. The pilot’s success has led this practice to be mainstream. Areas of focus for our introduction of this technique:
o Agility Coaching with Mobs
Instead of using traditional techniques, teams have learned to disseminate knowledge by mobbing through refinement sessions, enabling the most experienced developer to pass on their knowledge of a particular system to the entire team.
o Spreading innersource with Mobs
Innersourcing can be difficult, especially bringing in new contributors, mobbing has helped us make this process easier. New contributors get to work with trusted contributors during our mobbing sessions to gain better understanding of the projects and get themselves up and running.
o Design first approach with Mobs
In general, "API Design First" is about closing the feedback loop substantially. We now use mobbing to bring all the necessary stakeholders together to collaborate on the design to improve this feedback loop.
