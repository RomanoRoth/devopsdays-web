### Agile Coach - Delta Air Lines
Diverse Technology, Telecom, and Consulting Background spanning Product Development, Lean 6 Sigma Operational Improvements, Agile, Certified Scrum Master, Business Analysis, Sales, Account Management, and Leadership Roles. I am also a recent MBA graduate from the Georgia Tech Scheller College of Business where I completed my Lean 6 Sigma Black Belt. Continuing my journey as a lifelong learner, this fall I will be teaching Management Information systems at Georgia Gwinnett College.

Currently, I am in a rotational Information Technology role at Delta Air Lines. My rotations involved working in Tech Ops as a Scrum Master, Project Manager, and Business Analyst with exposure to all aspects of Delta IT. Previous projects I led include: Line Maintenance PartTrac Chat Bot, Enterprise Tablet rollout, and 6 Sigma for RFC failure reduction. My most recent rotation is with Agile COE where I have been at the Dojo since September 2017. While at Dojo, I have coached 26 Scrum Masters and facilitated 30 training courses in topics ranging from Intro to Agile to Estimation to Teaming. Helping teams work more effectively is one of my passions, which led me to pilot Mob Programming at Delta’s Dojo. To date, I have led training for over 60 participants who are now actively mobbing. Lastly, I have facilitated and provided feedback for over 200 scrum ceremonies.

I am interested in Delta’s agile transformation journey because I have seen the profound effects agile can have on teams, specifically the 26 teams that came through Dojo. Teams have entered Dojo with different agile proficiencies ranging from waterfall to advanced agile and all of them left in a better state than they came entered. For some that meant releasing incremental software faster and for others they were able to bond and experience teaming. I strive to be a part of something bigger than myself and this journey allows me to do just that. Coaching one team is wonderful, but I want to be responsible for spreading “the good” to many teams.
