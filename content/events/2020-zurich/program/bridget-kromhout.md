Kubernetes container orchestration meets a modern microservice architecture: excitement! Plus, increasing needs related to traffic management, observability, access control, and the like. The CNCF [Service Mesh Interface](https://smi-spec.io/) community has defined a specification for standard service mesh APIs to ensure plugins work on many meshes and allow for choice of mesh provider. Microsoft has launched a new open source project, [Open Service Mesh](https://openservicemesh.io/) (OSM), which is a lightweight and extensible Envoy-based service mesh that implements the SMI APIs and runs on Kubernetes. Tune in for this service mesh ecosystem discussion if youâ€™re interested in this space and trying to figure out your next moves.
